This method is applied to modeling growth of arbitrary cohesive cracks. The growth of the cohesive zone is governed by requiring the stress intensity factors at the tip of the cohesive zone to vanish. This energetic approach avoids the evaluation of stresses at the mathematical tip of the crack. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by simulations of cohesive crack growth in concrete.",

abstract = {Abstract A model which allows the introduction of displacements jumps to conventional finite elements is developed. The path of the discontinuity is completely independent of the mesh structure. Unlike so-called ‘embedded discontinuity’ models, which are based on incompatible strain modes, there is no restriction on the type of underlying solid finite element that can be used and displacement jumps are continuous across element boundaries. Using finite element shape functions as partitions of unity, the displacement jump across a crack is represented by extra degrees of freedom at existing nodes. To model fracture in quasi-brittle heterogeneous materials, a cohesive crack model is used. Numerical simulations illustrate the ability of the method to objectively simulate fracture with unstructured meshes. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We also demonstrate the mixability between FEM and VEM; in particular, applications of VEM for coupling non-conforming discretizations and for local refinement are presented, showing higher versatility compared to FEM. Computer implementation aspects in displacement-based finite element codes are thoroughly explained, remarking on the main differences with respect to standard FEM.",

abstract = {Summary This article introduces a meshing technique focused on fast and real-time simulation in a biomedical context. We describe in details our algorithm, which starts from a basic Octree regarding the constraints imposed by the simulation, and then, mixed-element patterns are applied over transitions between coarse and fine regions. The use of surface patterns, also composed by mixed elements, allows us to better represent curved domains decreasing the odds of creating invalid elements by adding as few nodes as possible. In contrast with other meshing techniques, we let the user define regions of greater refinement, and as a consequence of that refinement, we add as few nodes as possible to produce a mesh that is topologically correct. Therefore, our meshing technique gives more control on the number of nodes of the final mesh. We show several examples where the quality of the final mesh is acceptable, even without using quality filters. We believe that this new meshing technique is in the correct direction toward real-time simulation in the biomedical field. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = "A polyhedral mesh fulfills the Delaunay condition if the vertices of each polyhedron are co-spherical and each polyhedron circum- sphere is point-free. If Delaunay tessellations are used together with the finite volume method, it is not necessary to partition each polyhedron into tetrahedra; co-spherical elements can be used as final elements. This paper presents a mixed-element mesh gen- erator based on the modified octree approach that has been adapted to generate polyhedral Delaunay meshes. The main difference with its predecessor is to include a new algorithm to compute Delaunay tessellations for each 1-irregular cuboids (cuboids with at most one Steiner point on their edges) that minimize the number of mesh elements. In particular, we show that when Steiner points are located at edge midpoints, 24 different co-spherical elements can appear while tessellating 1-irregular cubes. By inserting internal faces and edges to these new elements, this number can be reduced to 13. When 1-irregular cuboids with aspect ratio equal to √2 are tessellated, 10 co-spherical elements are required. If 1-irregular cuboids have aspect ratio between 1 and √2, all the tessellations are adequate for the finite volume method. The proposed algorithm can be applied to any point set to compute the Delaunay tessellation inside the convex hull of the point set. Simple polyhedral Delaunay meshes generated by using the adapted mesh generator are shown.",

Given a set of sites V = {vk}nk=1 ⊂ ℝd and a mesh X with vertices in ℝd connected by triangles, the restricted Voronoi diagram partitions X by computing for each site the portion of X for which the site is the nearest. The restricted Voronoi diagram is the intersection between the regular Voronoi diagram and the mesh. Depending on the site distribution or the ambient space dimension computing the regular Voronoi diagram may not be feasible using classical algorithms. In this paper, we extend Lévy and Bonneel's approach [LB12] based on nearest neighbor queries. We show that their method is limited when the sites are not located on X. We propose a new algorithm for computing restricted Voronoi which reduces the number of sites considered for each triangle of the mesh and scales smoothly when the sites are far from the surface.},

abstract = "Delaunay refinement is a technique for generating unstructured meshes of triangles for use in interpolation, the finite element method, and the finite volume method. In theory and practice, meshes produced by Delaunay refinement satisfy guaranteed bounds on angles, edge lengths, the number of triangles, and the grading of triangles from small to large sizes. This article presents an intuitive framework for analyzing Delaunay refinement algorithms that unifies the pioneering mesh generation algorithms of L. Paul Chew and Jim Ruppert, improves the algorithms in several minor ways, and most importantly, helps to solve the difficult problem of meshing nonmanifold domains with small angles. Although small angles inherent in the input geometry cannot be removed, one would like to triangulate a domain without creating any new small angles. Unfortunately, this problem is not always soluble. A compromise is necessary. A Delaunay refinement algorithm is presented that can create a mesh in which most angles are 30° or greater and no angle is smaller than arcsin[(3/2)sin(φ/2)]∼(3/4)φ, where φ⩽60°is the smallest angle separating two segments of the input domain. New angles smaller than 30° appear only near input angles smaller than 60°. In practice, the algorithm's performance is better than these bounds suggest. Another new result is that Ruppert's analysis technique can be used to reanalyze one of Chew's algorithms. Chew proved that his algorithm produces no angle smaller than 30° (barring small input angles), but without any guarantees on grading or number of triangles. He conjectures that his algorithm offers such guarantees. His conjecture is conditionally confirmed here: if the angle bound is relaxed to less than 26.5°, Chew's algorithm produces meshes (of domains without small input angles) that are nicely graded and size-optimal.",

In two dimensions, the algorithm can be formulated in terms of the Delaunay insertion of both midpoints of terminal edges (the common longest-edge of a pair of Delaunay triangles) and midpoints of boundary related edges in the current mesh. For the processing of a small angled triangle in the current mesh, the terminal-edge is found as the final longest-edge of the finite chain of triangles that neighbor on a longest edge — the longest edge propagating path of the small angled triangle. Three boundary-related point insertion operations, which prevent nonconvergence behavior, are discussed in detail. The triangle improvement properties of the point insertion operations are used to prove that optimal-size triangulations, with smallest-angle greater than or equal to 30° are always produced.",

The mesh generator can provide, among other things, the input needed for finite element and optimization codes that use linear convex polygons. In topology optimization, polygonal discretizations have been shown not to be susceptible to numerical instabilities such as checkerboard patterns in contrast to lower order triangular and quadrilaterial meshes. Also, the use of polygonal elements makes possible meshing of complicated geometries with a self-contained Matlab code. The main ingredients of the present mesh generator are the implicit description of the domain and the centroidal Voronoi diagrams used for its discretization. The signed distance function provides all the essential information about the domain geometry and offers great flexibility to construct a large class of domains via algebraic expressions. Examples are provided to illustrate the capabilities of the code, which is compact and has fewer than 135 lines.",

The discussion is restricted to two-dimensional domains where the generated Voronoi diagram partitions the domain into irregular covex poylgons. This paper forms a sequel to an earlier paper on mesh generation using Dirichlet tessellation techniques by Ghosh and Mukhopadhyay. Two formulations have been developed, considering possible different situations. The first can be easily applicable to the analysis of structured materials that are modeled by a set of isolated material points in a continuum. The second formulation can find use in problems of finite deformation problems, where tessellation may be used as a means of obtaining a natural Lagrangian discretization of a deforming medium to avoid problems associated with mesh distortion.",

abstract = "A variational principle is applied to the transient heat conduction analysis of complex solids of arbitrary shape with temperature and heat flux boundary conditions. The finite element discretization technique is used to reduce the continuous spatial solution into a finite number of time-dependent unknowns. The continuum is divided into subregions (elements) in which the temperature field variable is approximated by Rayleigh-Ritz polynomial expansions in terms of the values of the temperatures at prescribed boundary points of the subregions. These temperatures at the node points act as generalized coordinates of the system and, being common to adjacent subregions, enable appropriate continuity requirements to be satisfied over the entire continuum. The variational principle yields Euler equations of the Lagrangian form which result in the development of an equivalent set of first order, ordinary differential equations in terms of the nodal temperatures. A unique method of numerical solution of these equations is introduced which is stable and requires a minimum of computer effort. Elements of various shapes and their associated temperature fields are discussed for one, two and three-dimensional bodies. The method is developed in detail for two-dimensional bodies which are idealized by systems of triangular elements. The development of a digital computer program is discussed and several examples are given to illustrate the validity and practicality of the method.",

The basic techniques used in computational geometry are all covered: polygon triangualtions, convex hulls, Voronoi diagrams, arrangements, geometric searching, and motion planning. The self-contained treatment presumes only an elementary knowledge of mathematics, but it reaches topics on the frontier of current research. Thus professional programmers will find it a useful tutorial.},

abstract="In this work, we propose new packing algorithm designed for the generation of polygon meshes to be used for modeling of rock and porous media based on the virtual element method. The packing problem to be solved corresponds to a two-dimensional packing of convex-shape polygons and is based on the locus operation used for the advancing front approach. Additionally, for the sake of simplicity, we decided to restrain the polygon rotation in the packing process. Three heuristics are presented to simplify the packing problem: density heuristic, gravity heuristic and the multi-layer packing. The decision made by those three heuristic are prioritizing on minimizing the area, inserting polygons on the minimum Y coordinate and pack polygons in multiple layers dividing the input in multiple lists, respectively. Finally, we illustrate the potential of the generated meshes by solving a diffusion problem, where the discretized domain consisted in polygons and spaces with different conductivities. Due to the arbitrary shape of polygons and spaces that are generated by the packing algorithm, the virtual element method was used to solve the diffusion problem numerically.",
