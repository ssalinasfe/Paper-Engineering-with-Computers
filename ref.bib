abstract = {A common representation in 3-D computer vision is the polygonal surface mesh because meshes can model objects of arbitrary shape and are easily constructed from sensed 3-D data. The resolution of a surface mesh is the overall spacing between vertices that comprise the mesh. Because sensed 3-D points are often unevenly distributed, the resolution of a surface mesh is often poorly defined. We present an algorithm that transforms a mesh with an uneven spacing between vertices into a mesh with a more even spacing between vertices, thus improving its definition of resolution. In addition, we show how the algorithm can be used to control the resolution of surface meshes, making them amenable to multiresolution approaches in computer vision. The structure of our algorithm is modeled on iterative mesh simplification algorithms common in computer graphics; however, the individual steps in our algorithm are designed specifically to control mesh resolution. An even spacing between vertices is generated by applying a sequence of local edge operations that promote uniform edge lengths while preserving mesh shape. To account for polyhedral objects, we introduce an accurate shape change measure that permits edge operations along sharp creases. By locally bounding the total change in mesh shape, drastic changes in global shape are prevented. We show results from many 3-D sensing domains including computed tomography, range imaging, and digital elevation map construction.}

abstract = {The Voronoi diagram is a fundamental geometric structure widely used in various fields, especially in computer graphics and geometry computing. For a set of points in a compact domain (i.e. a bounded and closed 2D region or a 3D volume), some Voronoi cells of their Voronoi diagram are infinite or partially outside of the domain, but in practice only the parts of the cells inside the domain are needed, as when computing the centroidal Voronoi tessellation. Such a Voronoi diagram confined to a compact domain is called a clipped Voronoi diagram. We present an efficient algorithm to compute the clipped Voronoi diagram for a set of sites with respect to a compact 2D region or a 3D volume. We also apply the proposed method to optimal mesh generation based on the centroidal Voronoi tessellation.}

The path of the discontinuity is completely independent of the mesh structure. Unlike so-called ‘embedded discontinuity’ models, which are based on incompatible strain modes, there is no restriction on the type of underlying solid finite element that can be used and displacement jumps are continuous across element boundaries. Using finite element shape functions as partitions of unity, the displacement jump across a crack is represented by extra degrees of freedom at existing nodes. To model fracture in quasi-brittle heterogeneous materials, a cohesive crack model is used. Numerical simulations illustrate the ability of the method to objectively simulate fracture with unstructured meshes. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We describe in details our algorithm, which starts from a basic Octree regarding the constraints imposed by the simulation, and then, mixed-element patterns are applied over transitions between coarse and fine regions. The use of surface patterns, also composed by mixed elements, allows us to better represent curved domains decreasing the odds of creating invalid elements by adding as few nodes as possible. In contrast with other meshing techniques, we let the user define regions of greater refinement, and as a consequence of that refinement, we add as few nodes as possible to produce a mesh that is topologically correct. Therefore, our meshing technique gives more control on the number of nodes of the final mesh. We show several examples where the quality of the final mesh is acceptable, even without using quality filters. We believe that this new meshing technique is in the correct direction toward real-time simulation in the biomedical field. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

If Delaunay tessellations are used together with the finite volume method, it is not necessary to partition each polyhedron into tetrahedra; co-spherical elements can be used as final elements. This paper presents a mixed-element mesh gen- erator based on the modified octree approach that has been adapted to generate polyhedral Delaunay meshes. The main difference with its predecessor is to include a new algorithm to compute Delaunay tessellations for each 1-irregular cuboids (cuboids with at most one Steiner point on their edges) that minimize the number of mesh elements. In particular, we show that when Steiner points are located at edge midpoints, 24 different co-spherical elements can appear while tessellating 1-irregular cubes. By inserting internal faces and edges to these new elements, this number can be reduced to 13. When 1-irregular cuboids with aspect ratio equal to √2 are tessellated, 10 co-spherical elements are required. If 1-irregular cuboids have aspect ratio between 1 and √2, all the tessellations are adequate for the finite volume method. The proposed algorithm can be applied to any point set to compute the Delaunay tessellation inside the convex hull of the point set. Simple polyhedral Delaunay meshes generated by using the adapted mesh generator are shown.",

abstract = {We present a general virtual element method (VEM) framework for finite elasticity, which emphasizes two issues: element-level volume change (volume average of the determinant of the deformation gradient) and stabilization. To address the former issue, we provide exact evaluation of the average volume change in both 2D and 3D on properly constructed local displacement spaces. For the later issue, we provide a new stabilization scheme that is based on the trace of the material tangent modulus tensor, which captures highly heterogeneous and localized deformations. Two VEM formulations are presented: a two-field mixed and an equivalent displacement-based, which is free of volumetric locking. Convergence and accuracy of the VEM formulations are verified by means of numerical examples, and engineering applications are demonstrated.}

abstract = {While the literature on numerical methods (e.g. finite elements and, to a certain extent, virtual elements) concentrates on convex elements, there is a need to probe beyond this limiting constraint so that the field can be further explored and developed. Thus, in this paper, we employ the virtual element method for non-convex discretizations of elastodynamic problems in 2D and 3D using an explicit time integration scheme. In the formulation, a diagonal matrix-based stabilization scheme is proposed to improve performance and accuracy. To address efficiency, a critical time step is approximated and verified using the maximum eigenvalue of the local (rather than global) system. The computational results demonstrate that the virtual element method is able to consistently handle general nonconvex elements and even non-simply connected elements, which can lead to convenient modeling of arbitrarily-shaped inclusions in composites.}

abstract = "Delaunay refinement is a technique for generating unstructured meshes of triangles for use in interpolation, the finite element method, and the finite volume method. In theory and practice, meshes produced by Delaunay refinement satisfy guaranteed bounds on angles, edge lengths, the number of triangles, and the grading of triangles from small to large sizes. This article presents an intuitive framework for analyzing Delaunay refinement algorithms that unifies the pioneering mesh generation algorithms of L. Paul Chew and Jim Ruppert, improves the algorithms in several minor ways, and most importantly, helps to solve the difficult problem of meshing nonmanifold domains with small angles. Although small angles inherent in the input geometry cannot be removed, one would like to triangulate a domain without creating any new small angles. Unfortunately, this problem is not always soluble. A compromise is necessary. A Delaunay refinement algorithm is presented that can create a mesh in which most angles are 30° or greater and no angle is smaller than arcsin[(3/2)sin(φ/2)]∼(3/4)φ, where φ⩽60°is the smallest angle separating two segments of the input domain. New angles smaller than 30° appear only near input angles smaller than 60°. In practice, the algorithm's performance is better than these bounds suggest. Another new result is that Ruppert's analysis technique can be used to reanalyze one of Chew's algorithms. Chew proved that his algorithm produces no angle smaller than 30° (barring small input angles), but without any guarantees on grading or number of triangles. He conjectures that his algorithm offers such guarantees. His conjecture is conditionally confirmed here: if the angle bound is relaxed to less than 26.5°, Chew's algorithm produces meshes (of domains without small input angles) that are nicely graded and size-optimal.",

In two dimensions, the algorithm can be formulated in terms of the Delaunay insertion of both midpoints of terminal edges (the common longest-edge of a pair of Delaunay triangles) and midpoints of boundary related edges in the current mesh. For the processing of a small angled triangle in the current mesh, the terminal-edge is found as the final longest-edge of the finite chain of triangles that neighbor on a longest edge — the longest edge propagating path of the small angled triangle. Three boundary-related point insertion operations, which prevent nonconvergence behavior, are discussed in detail. The triangle improvement properties of the point insertion operations are used to prove that optimal-size triangulations, with smallest-angle greater than or equal to 30° are always produced.",

abstract="We present a simple and robust Matlab code for polygonal mesh generation that relies on an implicit description of the domain geometry. The mesh generator can provide, among other things, the input needed for finite element and optimization codes that use linear convex polygons. In topology optimization, polygonal discretizations have been shown not to be susceptible to numerical instabilities such as checkerboard patterns in contrast to lower order triangular and quadrilaterial meshes. Also, the use of polygonal elements makes possible meshing of complicated geometries with a self-contained Matlab code. The main ingredients of the present mesh generator are the implicit description of the domain and the centroidal Voronoi diagrams used for its discretization. The signed distance function provides all the essential information about the domain geometry and offers great flexibility to construct a large class of domains via algebraic expressions. Examples are provided to illustrate the capabilities of the code, which is compact and has fewer than 135 lines.",

This paper forms a sequel to an earlier paper on mesh generation using Dirichlet tessellation techniques by Ghosh and Mukhopadhyay. Two formulations have been developed, considering possible different situations. The first can be easily applicable to the analysis of structured materials that are modeled by a set of isolated material points in a continuum. The second formulation can find use in problems of finite deformation problems, where tessellation may be used as a means of obtaining a natural Lagrangian discretization of a deforming medium to avoid problems associated with mesh distortion.",

abstract = "A variational principle is applied to the transient heat conduction analysis of complex solids of arbitrary shape with temperature and heat flux boundary conditions. The finite element discretization technique is used to reduce the continuous spatial solution into a finite number of time-dependent unknowns. The continuum is divided into subregions (elements) in which the temperature field variable is approximated by Rayleigh-Ritz polynomial expansions in terms of the values of the temperatures at prescribed boundary points of the subregions. These temperatures at the node points act as generalized coordinates of the system and, being common to adjacent subregions, enable appropriate continuity requirements to be satisfied over the entire continuum. The variational principle yields Euler equations of the Lagrangian form which result in the development of an equivalent set of first order, ordinary differential equations in terms of the nodal temperatures. A unique method of numerical solution of these equations is introduced which is stable and requires a minimum of computer effort. Elements of various shapes and their associated temperature fields are discussed for one, two and three-dimensional bodies. The method is developed in detail for two-dimensional bodies which are idealized by systems of triangular elements. The development of a digital computer program is discussed and several examples are given to illustrate the validity and practicality of the method.",

Résumé
On établit l'utilité de la méthode de l'élément fini pour les calculs des facteurs d'intensité de la tension de rupture en bout. Bien qu'habituellement les méthodes d'éléments finis ne peuvent pas représenter la singularité de la force de rupture en bout, il est possible d'obtenir par un procédé simple des valeurs significatives de ces facteurs d'intensité. Les résultats sont comparés à ceux des autres solutions analytiques, et une corrélation supplémentaire est effectuée avec types spécimens différents d'essai de rupture.
Zusammenfassung
Die Zweckmässigkeit der Methode der endlichen Elemente für die Errechnung von Spannungsfaktoren an Rissspitzen wird dargelegt. Obzwar die gewöhnlichen Methoden der endlichen Elemente nicht imstande sind die Singularität der Rissspitzenspannung vorzustellen, können mittels eines einfachen Verfahrens doch sinnvolle Werte für Spannungsfaktoren an den Rissspitzen erhalten werden. Die Ergebnisse werden nicht nur mit den Ergebnissen anderer analytischer Lösungen verglichen, sondern es wird auch eine zusätzliche Korrelation von zwei verschiedenen Typen von Bruchprobekörpern vorgenommen.",

Material homogenization allows retrieving material properties through suitable volume averaging procedures, starting from a detailed representation of the micro-constituents of the considered material. The representation of such microstructure constitutes a remarkable effort in terms of data/mesh preparation, especially when there is not evident microstructural regularity. For such a reason, computational micromechanics may represent a challenging benchmark for showing the potential of VEM. In this contribution, polycrystalline materials are considered as an application. The proposed technique constitutes a first step towards modelling of damage processes in micro-structured materials}

abstract = { In this paper, we introduce and analyze a mixed virtual element method (mixed-VEM) for the two-dimensional Brinkman model of porous media flow with non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. More precisely, we employ a dual-mixed formulation in which the only unknown is given by the pseudostress, whereas the velocity and pressure are computed via postprocessing formulae. We first recall the corresponding variational formulation, and then summarize the main mixed-VEM ingredients that are required for our discrete analysis. In particular, in order to define a calculable discrete bilinear form, whose continuous version involves deviatoric tensors, we propose two well-known alternatives for the local projector onto a suitable polynomial subspace, which allows the explicit integration of these terms. Next, we show that the global discrete bilinear form satisfies the hypotheses required by the Lax–Milgram lemma. In this way, we conclude the well-posedness of our mixed-VEM scheme and derive the associated a priori error estimates for the virtual solution as well as for the fully computable projection of it. Furthermore, we also introduce a second element-by-element postprocessing formula for the pseudostress, which yields an optimally convergent approximation of this unknown with respect to the broken ℍ(div)-norm. Finally, several numerical results illustrating the good performance of the method and confirming the theoretical rates of convergence are presented. }

abstract = "Q-Morph is a new algorithm for generating all-quadrilateral meshes on bounded three-dimensional surfaces. After first triangulating the surface, the triangles are systematically transformed to create an all-quadrilateral mesh. An advancing front algorithm determines the sequence of triangle transformations. Quadrilaterals are formed by using existing edges in the triangulation, by inserting additional nodes, or by performing local transformations to the triangles. A method typically used for recovering the boundary of a Delaunay mesh is used on interior triangles to recover quadrilateral edges. Any number of triangles may be merged to form a single quadrilateral. Topological clean-up and smoothing are used to improve final element quality. Q-Morph generates well-aligned rows of quadrilaterals parallel to the boundary of the domain while maintaining a limited number of irregular internal nodes. The proposed method also offers the advantage of avoiding expensive intersection calculations commonly associated with advancing front procedures. A series of examples of Q-Morph meshes are also presented to demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method.",

abstract = {A new scheme for the generation of a quadrilateral element mesh is presented. The algorithm makes use of the fact that a triangular element mesh bounded by an even number of line segments can always be converted into quadrilaterals. By using the advancing front technique for schematically merging of triangular elements, high-quality well-graded quadrilateral meshes can be formed without any tedious treatment for isolated triangles. Unlike many other methods, no cut-lines or manual division of the problem domain into simpler subregions is required before conversion. As the number and the position of the boundary nodes are not altered during the mesh generation process, different material regions sharing common boundary lines can be treated individually. Since a background triangular mesh is all that is needed, the process can be applied to any arbitrary 2D domain with or without internal openings. In fact, the method has an equal area of application as a general triangulator. This also implies that the proposed scheme can be used to generate strongly graded quadrilateral meshes of the same gradation effect as the background triangular meshes for adaptive finite element analysis.}

The packing problem to be solved corresponds to a two-dimensional packing of convex-shape polygons and is based on the locus operation used for the advancing front approach. Additionally, for the sake of simplicity, we decided to restrain the polygon rotation in the packing process. Three heuristics are presented to simplify the packing problem: density heuristic, gravity heuristic and the multi-layer packing. The decision made by those three heuristic are prioritizing on minimizing the area, inserting polygons on the minimum Y coordinate and pack polygons in multiple layers dividing the input in multiple lists, respectively. Finally, we illustrate the potential of the generated meshes by solving a diffusion problem, where the discretized domain consisted in polygons and spaces with different conductivities. Due to the arbitrary shape of polygons and spaces that are generated by the packing algorithm, the virtual element method was used to solve the diffusion problem numerically.",
